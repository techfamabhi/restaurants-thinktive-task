## I have implemented the FOODIEDELIGHT functionality for the Restaurant Admin, using React JS for the frontend and Laravel PHP framework for the backend. The features include category filtering, sorting, pagination, and search functionality.

## I have also created an API for the Restaurant module. You can review the code and functionality through the attached photos and the GitHub link
